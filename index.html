               Howdy! We're Megana (Moose) and Sarah (Goose) and we started our 
               Instagram account, @_moose.n.goose_ in 2022 to document our weird and comical life. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Since then, we've been able to realize some of our biggest dreams: 
               seeing the Northern Lights, going to a Lana Del Rey concert, and camping in a national park, to name a few.
               Come along for the ride, it's a wild one!
